{{$NEXT}}
    - Change name of "cache-IO" method "cache", and add a
      candidate without arguments
    - Change name of "cache-identity" method to "update-identity"
      as that more describes what it does
    - Added support for "provides", "tests", "scripts" and "code"
      methods, each providing an IO to a file containing absolute
      paths to be used by e.g. the --from-files option of "rak"
